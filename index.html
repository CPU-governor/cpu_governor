			<h2>Hey there! I'm CPU Governor</h2>
			<p class="p_center">A passionate programmer diving deep into the world of code and creativity. Whether it's Systems programing in C and C++, or building sleek Games with SDL or Godot, I always thrive on Optimizing performance and squeezing every last drop of efficiency out of my code.</p>
			<h3>Programming Skills</h3>
			<p>At the moment i code in :</p>
			<ul>
			<li>C </li>
			<li>C++ </li>
<li>Python</li>
<li> And a little bit of Java, Pascal and Shell</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3 id="projects"> Projects i have worked on </h3>
			<ul>
				<li> <a>Mini Database</a>: Simple Data base system that keeps track of items in a store or warehouse, it store's data about each product's quantity, price, and supplier's information if more is to be ordered. Almost like the database used by online retail platform like AliExpress, Amazon e.t.c</li>
				<li><a> Game Development in C</a>: Using SDL2 in C, i built some basic Acade games like snake game, pong and also did alot of shape's rendering lol.</li>
				<li><a> Shell Scripting projects</a>: I really wouldn't garauntee anyone that i am Good with Bash and anyone who has written in bash would agree with me that bash is a very ugly language lol :) but although i have built few shell scripting projects like
<div><ul>
<li>Alarm clock :  a simple Alarm clock in Shell, bash to be specific.</li>
<li>A shell Script to display system information.</li>
<li>Virus: previously i tried working on a Virus in bash but i was unable to, i have soon abandoned the project for now until i have the required knowlege to continue.</li>
<ul>
</div>
				
<li> <a>PASTA </a>: Properly know as Pascal Tool for Analysis (PASTA) is a project written in Pascal for Data Analysis on csv files and can crunch data to solve for mean, median  and can also plots some Graphs (Hyperbolic,Parabolic,Straight Line).</li>
<li><a>Light</a>: A Text Editor written in python using TKinter. Yes i know VS Code and Sublime text already exist but i'm just doing this for the experience. P.S Python comes pre-installed in all linux distro and TKinter comes pre-installed in python therefore it can easily be used without installing much dependencies. </li>
			</ul>

                    <li> linux is a very simple system, but you have to be a Genius to understand it's simplicity</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>It doesn't always have to be spectacular, If it works it works  why complicate simplicity</li>
