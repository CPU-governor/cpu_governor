                    	<li>i am not sure if C has taught me to think like a programmer or python is just really easy</li>
                    <li> linux is a very simple system, but you have to be a Genius to understand it's simplicity</li>
                    <li>Anything you don't want to do in javascript will eventually and can only be done in javascript, they is no running from that language</li>
                    <li> Those who plan Ahead stays Ahead</li>
